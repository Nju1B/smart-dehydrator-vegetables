Smart dehydrator for vegetables, my finl year project for B.Engr.



There’s almost no easier way to preserve food than dehydrating. Used for thousands of years to help food last without refrigeration, drying is one of the fastest and least expensive ways to save harvest hence lightens the weight of foods.

Traditionally, many households in Tanzania dehydrate vegetables by using energy from the sun, these particular drying methods are efficient but unsatisfactory since there slow drying anywhere between 2 to 7 days, this creates the danger of mould growth, over-heating or sometimes incomplete drying under unfavorable climatological conditions.

The proposed system constantly measures the temperature through the sensing unit and observing its variation, if the temperature is below 65°c it’s expected the fan and heater will be switched ON, while if the temperature exceeds the above mentioned temperature, the operation of fan and heater should cease, throughout all this process the results are going to be displayed on the LCD
